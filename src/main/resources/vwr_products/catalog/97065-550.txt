CF™640R antibodies are affinity-purified antibodies labeled with far-red fluorescent CF™640R, a member of the novel CF™ dye series developed by Biotium for labeling proteins and other biomolecules. CF™ dyes are designed to offer advantages in brightness, photostability, and/or specificity compared to other commercial dyes, and are available in colors spanning the visible, far-red, and near-infrared spectra. CF™640R is a far-red fluorescent dye with excitation/emission maxima at 642/662nm. CF™640R is spectrally similar to AlexaFluor®647, Cy®5, and DyLight®649. CF™640R is much brighter than Cy®5 and at least as bright as Alexa Fluor® 647 when excited at 633 or 635nm. However, the most important advantage of CF™640R is its exceptional photostability. CF™640R is far more photostable than the cyanine-based dyes Cy®5 and Alexa Fluor® 647, making it an excellent choice for demanding applications like confocal microscopy. CF™ dyes are covered by pending U.S. and international patents. CF™ is a trademark of Biotium, Inc. Alexa Fluor® is a registered trademark of Molecular Probes, Inc.
