Tyvek速 coveralls are manufactured from flash spun high density polyethylene to create a unique, nonwoven material that provides an inherent barrier to particles down to 1 micron in size. The fabric offers an ideal balance of protection, durability, and comfort, with no films or laminates to abrade or wear away. Tyvek速 coveralls are ideally suited for applications including lead and asbestos abatement/remediation, general maintenance operations, spray painting, and general cleanup. Coveralls feature serged seams, with multiple interlocking threads sewn around the raw edges of garment material to create a strong, stress-resistant seam. All garments have an attached respirator fit hood, elastic wrist openings for a secure fit, zipper front closure, and set sleeves. They are available with elastic ankle openings or with attached skid-resistant boots.
