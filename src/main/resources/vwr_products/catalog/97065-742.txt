Biotium offers a variety of streptavidin and anti-biotin antibody conjugates featuring our series of CF dyes. CF dyes are superior to other fluorescent dyes for protein labeling due to advantages in brightness, photostability, and water solubility. Streptavidin conjugates are typically used as secondary reagents to detect biotinylated probes such as primary antibodies for flow cytometry, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and other applications. Monoclonal mouse anti-biotin antibody reacts with biotin conjugated to antibodies or other proteins, and may show less non-specific binding to cells or tissues compared to streptavidin conjugates. Ordering Information: Streptavidin conjugates are supplied in lyophilized solid format. After reconstitution with 0.5 mL PBS, streptavidin concentration is 2 mg/mL with 0.01% sodium azide. Monoclonal mouse anti-biotin antibody conjugates are supplied at 2 mg/mL in PBS pH 7.4 containing 50% glycerol, 2 mg/mL BSA (IgG-free and protease-free), and 0.05% sodium azide.
