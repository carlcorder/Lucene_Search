Fluorescent lectins are versatile probes for detecting glycoconjugates and glycoproteins. CF™ dye lectin conjugates are labeled with Biotium’s next-generation fluorescent CF™ dyes, which offer advantages in brightness and photostability compared to other fluorescent dyes. Concanavalin A selectively binds to α-mannopyranosyl and α-glucopyranosyl residues. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binds selectively to N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid residues, and is used for neuronal tracing and as a bacterial gram stain. CF dye technology is covered by pending U.S. and international patents. Fluorescent lectins are versatile probes for detecting glycoconjugates and glycoproteins.
